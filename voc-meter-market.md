<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The VOC Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PID</li><li>Metal-oxide Semiconductor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The VOC meter market primarily consists of two types: PID (Photoionization Detector) and Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (MOS). PID meters utilize ultraviolet light to ionize volatile organic compounds, providing high sensitivity and rapid response, making them ideal for detecting low-level VOCs in various environments. In contrast, MOS sensors operate by measuring changes in resistance caused by VOCs on a heated metal oxide surface, offering robust and cost-effective solutions, although with potentially lower sensitivity and slower response times compared to PID technology.</p></p>
