<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non invasive Ventilation Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CPAP Ventilation Machine</li><li>BiPAP Ventilation Machine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The non-invasive ventilation machine market is primarily segmented into CPAP and BiPAP devices. CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) machines deliver a steady airflow to keep airways open during sleep, commonly used for obstructive sleep apnea. In contrast, BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) machines provide two levels of pressure: a higher pressure for inhalation and a lower pressure for exhalation, making them suitable for patients with more complex respiratory conditions. Both types enhance patient comfort and improve breathing efficiency.</p></p>
