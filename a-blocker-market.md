<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The α-blocker Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-selective Antagonists</li><li>Selective Antagonists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The α-blocker market is categorized into non-selective and selective antagonists. Non-selective antagonists target multiple α-adrenergic receptor subtypes, offering broader effects but potentially causing more side effects. Selective antagonists, on the other hand, are designed to target specific receptor subtypes, providing more precise treatment with reduced adverse effects. This distinction influences prescribing practices, patient response, and market dynamics, with selective antagonists increasingly preferred for conditions like hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia due to their targeted action and improved safety profiles.</p></p>
