<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The D-type Doppler Diagnostic Ultrasound Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CW</li><li>PW</li></ul></p>
<p><p>D-type Doppler Diagnostic Ultrasound Devices primarily include Continuous Wave (CW) and Pulsed Wave (PW) Doppler technologies. CW Doppler uses continuous sound waves to measure blood flow velocity, providing accurate information on high-speed flow but lacks depth resolution. PW Doppler, on the other hand, emits brief pulses of sound, allowing for specific depth measurement and better resolution but is limited in measuring high-velocity flows. Both types serve critical roles in cardiovascular diagnostics and non-invasive vascular assessments.</p></p>
